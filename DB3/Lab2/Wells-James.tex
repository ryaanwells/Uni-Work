\section*{Query 1}
Query C is our optimized query. It has the lowest overall cost in
comparison to Query A and B and also a lower size cost. This is due to
Query A not having any nested queries and less projections than the
other two. \\
\subsection*{Query A}

   title occurs more than once and remove the duplicates
   (using HAVING count(*)>1)

)

\section*{Query 2}
Query C is our optimized query. Even though A and B have the same
cost adding indices to either has reduced the cost. Also, we believe
that on a larger scale Query A should perform betteras the nested
query selecting only the songs that are a bonus song should reduce the
space complexity of the search.

\section*{Query 3}
Query C is our optimized query. We decided to optimize primarily by
using the faster ``UNION ALL'' instead of using ``UNION'' and having a
distinct higher up the table as this decreased the overall cost of the
query. Also adding two indices to the table has helped the overall
cost and the expense of making these indices was outweighed by this
gain.

Query C is our optimized query. Query C is Query A optimized by
removing redundant code and changing the way we pass tuples through
the query. We considered using an index, but the benefits of the index
did not counterbalance the cost.

   in a band.

   of the keyboard player.

\section*{Query 5}
\subsection*{Query A}
Query C is our optimized query. Both of our queries return the same
results for the given test data, but Query C will guarantee that there
is a singer on the top album returned. This was an intricacy
discovered too late for the change of one of our queries, so we are
aware that both queries may return different information depending on
the test data set.
The only optimization we could find for Query B (the one that
primarily guarantees a singer on the album) was to create an index on
the Members instruments. The cost of this is more than the saving of
the index, so this is only really valid if the query will be run more
than it is updated. However, and more interestingly, Query A will be
an optimization on Query B if there is a guarantee that every album
has a singer on the album.
\begin{verbatim}
/* ALLSONGS Shows every release by ID and its corresponding number of
   songs, which has been achieved here through a count. MAXSONGS uses
   a similar method to find the maximum number of songs that any album
   has. This means when they are inner joined, any releases that have
   the maximum number of songs are included, allowing for multiple
   albums to feature the most songs, for instance two could have 25
   and 25 could be the highest any has. What then happens is the
   singer is matched to a band through checks on foreign keys.
