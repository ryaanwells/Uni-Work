Professional Software Development 3
In keeping with the overall philosophy of Level 3, the design of this module is based on a commitment to link all of the course content to actual software development practice, so that the content is either motivated by the demands of student practical work or arises naturally from that practical work. This will be achieved by the use of an extended group exercise which will run in parallel with lectures and workshops. The PSD group exercise differs from the Level 3 Team Project in that it will be carefully designed to guarantee to all students appropriate structured opportunities to apply the methods and techniques presented in the lectures and workshops.
