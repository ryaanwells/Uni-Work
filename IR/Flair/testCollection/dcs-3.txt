        <h1>Java Programming 2 - KXDV</h1>
        <p><br />
          <strong>Aims: </strong>To further develop the students' experience in programming using a strongly typed language (Java) and strengthen their problem solving skills; to introduce the ideas that underpin object-oriented programming and ensure students gain the ability to appropriately utilise these concepts in developing small and medium sized software systems; to begin to develop the ability to select and re-use existing software components and libraries from a limited subset of standard libraries; and to provide an introduction to elementary graphical user-interface (GUI) development.<br />
