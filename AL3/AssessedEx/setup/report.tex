\section*{Status report}

Based upon the results found in the empirical results at the end of
this document I conclude that both my Dijkstra and Backtrack search
algorithms are fully functional and operate in expeted runtimes.
 
\section*{Implementation report}
Below I show  the implementation of the creation of the graph. Both
variations of the algorithm use this creation method.

  \Input{A file described inside
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] 
I implemented the Dijkstra search algorithm based on the pseudo-code
provided in the lecture notes, however I shall explain my
implementation here. 

\item[(b)]
Here, explain how you implemented the Backtrack search to compute and return the required information. Include a discussion of any steps that you took to improve efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Empirical results}
\tag{sec:emp}
Summarise the running times of your two programs on the data sets provided. If the program fails to terminate in, say, two minutes, simply report non-termination.
