A New Property And A Faster Algorithm For Baseball Elimination\\
Kevin D. Wayne\\

In the competitive world of professional sport, speculation over who or what team will finish at the top of a league occurs frequently and often with arbitrary decisions based on preference and intended audience. Some sports writers have pushed this speculation to claim certain teams or individuals have absolutely no chance of finishing top of their league based on their mathematical calculations. As interesting, and sometimes controversial as this may be, na\"{\i}ve calculations posed by sports pundits (such as one team or individual being eliminated from success as the total of their current wins and games still to play is less than the current league leader) are often easily calculated or obvious and underlying more interesting results may be found through an in-depth analysis of the league. This project aims to fulfil this analysis with a retrospective view on American Baseball Leagues from the 2011-2012 season.

\section*{Background}
Schwarts proposed the idea of utilizing a maximum flow computation through a directed graph to determine whether or not one team has been eliminated.
